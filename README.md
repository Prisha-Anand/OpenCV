METHOD INVOLVED
1)	We make use of the HAAR CASACDE ALGORITHM for face recognition. 
2)	Python along with PIP is installed and then the same is confirmed by typing the following in the cmd

3)	Type pip install opencv-contrib-python to download the opencv package which has inbuilt tools for face recognition which is necessary for the project.

WHAT IS OPENCV?

OpenCV is a computer vision library that offers a rich selection of algorithms used for object detection, face recognition, image restoration, and many other applications. Computer vision-based people detection is one of the libraryâ€™s features. Computer vision integrated with IOT can be used to automate a lot of activities. One such activity is the attendance in classes. 
Using OPENCV computer vision and python , with VSCODE, we can execute this and make it a reality.

WHAT IS HAAR CASCADE ALGORITHM?

Haar cascade is an algorithm that can detect objects in images, irrespective of their scale in image and location.This algorithm is not so complex and can run in real-time. We can train a haar-cascade detector to detect various objects like cars, bikes, buildings, fruits, etc. Haar cascade uses the cascading window, and it tries to compute features in every window and classify whether it could be an object.
The xml file for the same is available online.
We create a folder with sample photos and then attach the file location to the code.

We now have an algorithm which is capable of detecting multiple faces simultaneously and marking the attendance for them as well
The only KEY requirement is a QUALITY REAL-TIME VIDEO STREAMING ABILITY. Once this is done, it can be employed for attendance marking in a number of situations
For example, if there is a class of students, one camera at the front of the class will surveil the students and mark the attendance as well once the training period is done.
